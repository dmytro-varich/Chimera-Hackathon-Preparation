## Scrum Stages for the Hackathon

| **Stage**                   | **Description**                                                                                   | **Expected Outcome**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Sprint Planning**      | Discuss the idea, define the project goal, key processes, features, and tasks. Assign roles and responsibilities to team members. | Roles are clearly defined, the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is identified, and a task list (Product Backlog) is created. |
| **2. Sprint**               | Break tasks into smaller subtasks and implement the core functionality. Set deadlines.            | Each participant has a specific task with a clear deadline.                       |
| **3. Meeting**              | Discuss: <br> - What has been done? <br> - What is planned? <br> - What obstacles exist?          | Updated plan is formed, tasks are redistributed, and new deadlines are set.       |
| **4. Sprint**               | Execute tasks while meeting deadlines. Regularly synchronize and document results.                | Working prototypes, completed modules, or interfaces are delivered.               |
| **5. Testing**              | Validate the results: check for bugs, functionality, and performance.                             | Errors are detected and fixed; the product operates stably.                       |
| **6. Product Demonstration** | Prepare a presentation and project report. Showcase results: interfaces, working code, charts.    | Feedback is received; the final product or presentation is ready for the jury.    |
| **7. Retrospective**        | After the hackathon, discuss: <br> - What worked well? <br> - What can be improved?               | Lessons learned and actionable insights for future projects.                      |
